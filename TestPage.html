<h4>Cancer Drug Response:<br>
  </h4>



  
<p><img alt="Drug Diffusion" src="file:///Users/rahman/website/DrugDiffusion.jpg" align="left" hspace="20" width="266" height="133">According

 to the National Cancer Institute, almost 40% of men and women in the 
United States end up developing cancer in their lifetime, and total 
national expenditure on cancer is $125 Billion.&nbsp; While cancer 
deaths have fallen, the treatment of cancer is still predominant a trial
 and error process.&nbsp; This may result in delays to administer the 
correct treatment, the use of more invasive procedures, or an increase 
in toxicity due to superfluous treatments.&nbsp; Although these 
procedures may end up saving the patient, the treatment may also have an
 adverse effect on their quality of life.&nbsp; To remedy this cruel 
paradox my collaborators and I have been developing a framework of 
complete scientific investigations for optimal treatment through the use
 of robust mathematical models and biological experiments rooted in the 
rigors of physics.<br>
  </p>



  
<p>Once again, borrowing statistics from the National Cancer Institute, over 60% of <img alt="Dose Surface" src="file:///Users/rahman/website/DoseResponseSurf.jpg" align="right" hspace="10" width="166" height="129"><img alt="Dose Curve" src="file:///Users/rahman/website/DoseResponse.jpg" align="right" hspace="20" width="159" height="130">cancer
 cases and over 70% of cancer related deaths occur in Africa, 
Asia, and South America, having the worst effect on the poorest 
populations.&nbsp; Some of the easiest cancers to treat in the Western 
world, solid -- accessible tumors, are often fatal in poor 
nations.&nbsp; In industrialized nations the answers to solid tumors is 
simple -- operate.&nbsp; However, operation is generally quite complex, 
and costs a significant amount of money.&nbsp; This can be remedied by 
the use of drug injections into solid tumors, which is cheap and does 
not require much skill.&nbsp; We have developed mechanistic models for 
the fluidic interactions of the drug with the geometry and topography of
 the tumor coupled with statistical models of drug response for a 
population in order to achieve high predictive capabilities and show 
causality.&nbsp; In oncological studies the data is represented by 
dose-response curves, which we also have from our model, however having a
 model also gives us the ability to plot dose-time-response surfaces, 
which 
gives us a more fine-grained picture for the effects of the drug.<br>

<h4>Hydrodynamic Pilot Wave Theory:</h4>


<p><img src="Diagram.jpg" alt="Walking droplets diagram" align="left" hspace="10" width="260" height="205">It
 has been known for decades that, given proper conditions, a fluid drop 
can be made to bounce on a vibrating fluid bath for long times 
scales.&nbsp; In recent years, bouncing droplets have been observed to 
bifurcation from the bouncing state (no horizontal motion) to the 
walking state (horizontal motion).&nbsp; Experiments with walking 
droplets (called <i>walkers</i>) exhibit analogs of wave-particle 
duality and more specifically quantum-like phenomena.&nbsp; Studying 
walkers can enhance our understanding of quantum mechanics and<img src="file:///Users/rahman/website/WalkerPlots.jpg" alt="Walker plots" align="right" width="374" height="163"> suggest viable alternatives to the Copenhagen interpretation.<br>
</p>


<p>My research has focused on attacking walking dynamics on two fronts: developing simple models for various geometries
 and analyzing well established models via dynamical systems 
theory.&nbsp; Recently, this has manifested in modeling multiple non 
-chaotic walkers and single chaotic walkers in an annulus, proving the 
existence of various bifurcations and chaotic dynamics for my models. 
and analyzing novel bifurcations arising in models from previous 
investigations.<br>

<h4>Logical circuit dynamics:</h4>


<p>

          
</p>


<p><img src="IansExp.jpg" alt="RSFF experiment" align="left" hspace="10" width="366" height="197">Logical
 circuits are an integral part of modern life that are traditionally 
designed with minimal uncertainty.&nbsp; While this is straightforward 
to achieve with electronic logic, other logic families such as fluidic, 
chemical, and biological circuits naturally exhibit uncertainties due to
 the slower timescales of Boolean operations.&nbsp; In addition, chaotic
 logical circuits have the potential to be employed in random number 
generation, encryption, and fault tolerance.&nbsp; However, in order to 
exploit the properties of various nonlinear circuits they need to be 
studied further.&nbsp; Since experiments with large systems become 
difficult, tractable mathematical models that are amenable to analysis 
via dynamical systems theory are of particular value.<br>
</p>


<p>We developed a modeling framework for the chaotic Set/Reset flip-flop
 circuit and two types of chaotic NOR gates.&nbsp; Through this 
framework we derive discrete dynamical models for Set/Reset - type 
circuits with any number of NOR gates.&nbsp; Since the models are 
recurrence relations, the computational expense is quite low.&nbsp; 
Further, we conducted experiments to test these models, which shows both
 qualitatively and quantitatively close behavior between the theory and 
experiments.<br>

<h4>Theoretical developments in Dynamical Systems:</h4>
<h4>Sigma map bifurcations:</h4>

<p>Upon discovering a new global bifurcation in discrete dynamical 
models of walking droplets, we developed a generic dynamical system in 
order to generalize the theory of such bifurcations.&nbsp; From a 
graphical point of view, the invariant circle from an initial 
Neimark--Sacker bifurcation "blinks" on and off.&nbsp; This is due to 
the transition from tangential to transverse intersections of the 
unstable and stable manifolds of the saddle fixed point.<br>

<h4>Generalized Attracting Horseshoe:</h4>
<p>We had previously shown that attracting horseshoes may be generalized to be contained within a quadrilateral trapping <img src="file:///Users/rahman/website/TrappingRegion.jpg" alt="Trapping region" align="right" width="209" height="132">region.&nbsp; Through the NJIT Provost high school internship and the 
Provost Phase 1 undergraduate research grant, I mentored Karthik murthy 
(Bridgewater - Raritan High School) and Parth Sojitra (NJIT-ECE), under 
the supervision of Denis Blackmore, in finding numerical evidence of 
generalized attracting horseshoes (GAH) in Poincare maps of the Rossler 
attractor.&nbsp; I developed the algorithms to go from a first return 
map to a Poincare map and finally to find the quadrilateral trapping 
region for the supposed GAH.&nbsp; I then guided our students in writing
 the MATLAB codes to carry out the algorithms.&nbsp; While finding the 
trapping region numerically is not a proof, it does give us confidence 
that there exists a GAH in the Poincare map of the Rossler attractor.<br>

<h4>Chaotic scattering:</h4>



          
<p>Chaotic scattering has been studied from the early 70s and
            80s in solitary wave collisions from the Phi-Four equation (called Kink-Antikink
            collisions).&nbsp; These were mainly numerical studies that
            gave insight into the phenomena.&nbsp; However, since the
            equation is so difficult to work with there has been very
            little analysis done.&nbsp; In more recent years reduction
            techniques have been used to approximate the Phi-Four PDE
            with a system of ODEs and also as an iterated map.<br>
          </p>



          
<p>We have gone further and developed a mechanical analog (a
            ball rolling on a special surface) of chaotic scattering in
            Kink-Antikink collisions.&nbsp; This was done in order to
            conduct experiments.&nbsp; In addition to experiments we
            have analyzed the system thoroughly, including the
            dissipation that comes from friction.&nbsp; The experimental setup is
            shown bellow.<br>

<h4>Alternate proof of Peixoto's theorem in 1-D:</h4>



          
<p>Peixoto's theorem is one of the most important theorems in
            Dynamical Systems.&nbsp; It was proved by Dr. Mauricio Matos
            Peixoto in 1962.&nbsp; This proof is extremely involved -
            far too involved for most undergraduate students to
            follow.&nbsp; We develop an alternate - pedagogical proof of
            the simpler 1-D case, with the goal of allowing senior
            undergraduate students to follow and understand the proof
            and consequently some of the ideas involved in the much
            bigger proof of the 2-D case.

<h4>Particle Accelerator Physics:</h4>



          
<p> We numerically simulate the beam dynamics of the Energy
            Recovery Linear Particle Accelerator (ERL) design for
            Argonne National Lab's (ANL) Advanced Photon Source
            (APS).&nbsp; The code BI, created by Ivan Bazarov, is
            benchmarked against our own code for simpler
            Accelerators.&nbsp; Then the full ERL is simulated and the
            results analyzed.&nbsp; We conclude that the ERL, if built,
            would theoretically be stable.&nbsp; Therefore, it would be
            feasible to build it.</p>
