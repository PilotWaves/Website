        "If you are familiar with linear algebra or physics, then you already know the importance of matrices.  If you have not encountered matrices before, you can think of them as several row vectors stacked on top of each other or as several column vectors side by side.  For instance, the following matrix can either be seen as four row vectors, each with three entries, or as three column vectors, each with four entries.  We call it a $4\\times 3$ matrix.  \n",

A row vector with $n$ entries is a $1\\times n$ matrix and a column vector with $n$ entries is an $n\\times 1$ matrix.  \n",

You should try it on your own and see what error message you get.  I also did not show `C ** D`, but this is for more technical reasons.  The problem is that we only used whole numbers when constructing our matrices and so python assumed that we wanted elements of type `int` (more technically, type `int64`, but don't worry about the difference now).  Unfortunately, python does not allow raising integers to negative powers.  This is another example of how the type of a variable determines which operations you can perform on it.  There are a few ways to fix this.  The simplest is to construct the matrix using decimals in the first place so that python knows the elements are supposed to be floats.  "
