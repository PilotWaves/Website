Since ``x`` has the value ``8``, python replaces the right side with ``8 + 1``, which is ``9``.  Next, python sees the name ``x`` on the left side of the ``=`` operator, so it stores the value ``9`` in the memory reserved for the variable ``x``.  If later lines of code use the variable ``x``, it will have the value ``9``.  \n","\n","There are a few things worth remembering about assignment and variables in python: \n","\n","1) The left side of the ``=`` operator is the name of a variable.  You can't have any calculations or other code - just a single, valid variable name.  \n","\n","2) If the name on the left side is already the name of a variable in python's memory, then python will overwrite the value of that variable with the result from the right hand side.  This will not affect any previous calculations with the variable.  \n","\n","3) If the name on the left side is not already the name of a variable in python's memory, then python will reserve space for a new variable with that name and give it the value from the right hand side.  \n","\n","4) The right hand side can be as complicated as you want and can include code involving many different variables, but those variables must all be already defined.
