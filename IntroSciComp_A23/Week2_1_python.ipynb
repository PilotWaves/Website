In addition, it is easy to make mistakes with this much code and harder to hunt them down if we find out later that we made the wrong vector.  It is also tedious to make changes to this code.

Other languages like MATLAB or C use other keywords or symbols to show the end of a block of code, but python uses levels of indentation.  This can take a little getting used to.  PyCharm will handle the indentation for you, but it is important to be consistent.  If one line of code is indented by 1 space and another line is indented by 2 spaces, the code will either not run or not do what you want.  Moreover, different operating systems and text editors handle tabs differently, so a tab may or may not be the equivalent of some number of spaces.
