<h4>Physics-inspired modeling in the life sciences:</h4>
<p><br>
Similar phenomena often appear across many different branches of 
Science.&nbsp; Cancer dynamics, infectious disease, and information 
cascades, often involve interactions of various agents.&nbsp; Similar to
 Statistical Mechanics, these interactions appear random at the scale of
 a few agents, but average out at the scale of an entire population.<br>

<h4>Spatio-temporal cancer models:</h4>




  
<p><img alt="Drug Diffusion" src="DrugDiffusion.jpg" moz-do-not-send="true" width="266" align="left" hspace="20" height="133">According


 to the National Cancer Institute, almost 40% of people in the 
United States end up developing cancer in their lifetime, and total 
national expenditure on cancer is $125 Billion.&nbsp; While cancer 
deaths have fallen, the treatment of cancer is still predominant a trial
 and error process.&nbsp; This may result in delays to administer the 
correct treatment, the use of more invasive procedures, or an increase 
in toxicity due to superfluous treatments.&nbsp; Although these 
procedures may end up saving the patient, the treatment may also have an
 adverse effect on their quality of life.&nbsp; To remedy this cruel 
paradox my collaborators and I have been developing a framework of 
complete scientific investigations for optimal treatment through the use
 of robust mathematical models and biological experiments rooted in the 
rigors of physics.&nbsp; Moreover, the President's recent moonshot has 
opened a singular opportunity for cancer modeling studies.<br>
  </p>



  
<p>Dynamical models for cancer often describe either transport (of 
cells, drugs, nutrients, etc.) or averaged population dynamics, but 
seldom both.&nbsp; By coupling the two processes we are able to model a 
complete treatment strategy.&nbsp; First, I developed a simplest case 
model for drug injection into a tumor coupled with tumor cell 
death.&nbsp; Here (shown in the insert on the left) drug transport is 
modeled as radial diffusion with a leaky boundary obeying Newton's law 
of cooling, and the injection is modeled as an initial profile.&nbsp; 
The population is modeled as a binary process where a cell that is 
exposed to higher amounts of a drug will have a greater chance of death,
 which on aggregate becomes deterministic:&nbsp; the regions of the 
tumor with a higher than threshold con<img moz-do-not-send="true" src="CART_Schem.png" alt="CAR T-cell" width="165" align="right" hspace="10" height="157">centration
 will ablate and the regions with lower concentration will remain.&nbsp;
 This simplicity allows for fast computation, which is often necessary 
in real world scenarios.<br>
</p>
<p>More recently I have been collaborating with Katherine Owens and 
Ivana Bozic on the spatio-temporal dynamics of Chimeric antigen receptor
 T cell (CAR T-cell) therapies.&nbsp; Treatments supplemented by CAR 
T-cells have shown clinical success in varieties of Leukemias and 
Lymphomas, and there have been promising studies on solid tumors as 
well.&nbsp; Since the use of CAR T-cell therapies is still in its 
infancy, our work presents a singular opportunity for mathematical 
models to have an immense tangible impact on treatments that are 
currently being developed and those that will be developed in the near 
future.&nbsp; For our seminal study, we model the interaction between 
CAR T-cells and a tumor as a coupled reaction-diffusion model as 
illustrated on the right.<br>

<h4>Spatio-temporal infectious disease models:</h4>
<p><img moz-do-not-send="true" src="Cases_Day100.jpg" alt="Covid" width="458" align="left" hspace="10" height="100">I
 develop similar physics-inspired models for infectious disease.&nbsp; 
The surprisingly mercurial Covid-19 pandemic highlights the need for 
spatio-temporal models in order to predict the next ``hot zone'' and 
properly allocate resources to those regions.&nbsp; My collaborators, <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="https://www.math.ttu.edu/~anpeace/">Angie Peace</a>, <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="https://statistics.unl.edu/souparno-ghosh">Souparno Ghosh</a>,
 Ramesh Kesawan, and I modeled highly asymptomatic disease transmission 
using county-wise data from the current pandemic, which importantly 
captures captures the evolution of hot zones, which was not previously 
possible with standard population dynamics.&nbsp; Some preliminary 
results on the model simulation versus the actual data is shown on the 
left.<br>

<h4>Computational sociology:</h4>
<p>My MS student, Trevor, and I also developed a recurrence relation 
model for information cascades in social networks inspired by physical 
problems.&nbsp; Using Twitter as an example, through this model we are 
able to forecast the virality of a tweet.&nbsp; While most posts are 
innocuous, forecasting the virality of tweets that spread misinformation
 could help mitigate such a spread through targeted interventions.<br>

<h4>Damped-driven systems:</h4>
<p>Damped-driven systems are ubiquitous in nature from Physics to 
Sociology.&nbsp; Heuristically, the concept of damped-driven systems is 
quite simple.&nbsp; If we consider the un-damped un-forced ordinary 
differential equation (ODE)&nbsp; x'' + ax = 0; a &gt; 0, we know that 
the solutions can only be sinusoidal.&nbsp; If we now add a damping 
term, bx', the solutions become more complex with exponential terms 
multiplying the sinusoidal terms.&nbsp; Finally, if we drive the ODE 
with some non-autonomous forcing f(t), the system exhibits even more 
complex behavior and can even become chaotic if it no longer satisfies 
the hypothesis of the <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9%E2%80%93Bendixson_theorem">Poincaré–Bendixson theorem</a>.<br>

<h4>Walking droplets:</h4>



<p><img moz-do-not-send="true" src="Experiment_DropletTrajectory_cropped.jpg" alt="Walking Droplets" width="150" align="left" hspace="10" height="150"><img moz-do-not-send="true" src="AnglesAtImpact_Linearized.jpg" alt="Hydrodynamic-Kinematic Model" width="189" align="left" hspace="5" height="149">It

 has been known for decades that, given proper conditions, a fluid drop 
can be made to bounce on a vibrating fluid bath for long times 
scales.&nbsp; In recent years, bouncing droplets have been observed to 
bifurcate from the bouncing state (no horizontal motion) to the 
walking state (horizontal motion).&nbsp; Experiments with walking 
droplets (called <i>walkers</i>) exhibit analogs of wave-particle 
duality and more specifically quantum-like phenomena.&nbsp; Studying 
walkers can enhance our understanding of quantum mechanics and suggest viable alternatives to the Copenhagen interpretation.<br>
</p>



<p>My research has focused on modeling walking droplet dynamics to analyze the long-time statistics and on <img moz-do-not-send="true" src="Kick_Gain-Loss_1K.jpg" alt="Cobweb" width="169" align="right" hspace="5" height="142">developing experiments producing quantum-like behavior.&nbsp; Recently, this has <img moz-do-not-send="true" src="ZoomedPeriodDoubling.jpg" alt="Period Doubling" width="159" align="right" hspace="5" height="119">manifested
 in modeling walkers on annulus and elliptical corrals with impurities, 
and analyzing those models via rigorous dynamical systems theory.&nbsp; 
From the analysis we observe and prove that the droplets experience 
similar bifurcation behavior that is canonical to a wide class of 
damped-driven systems.&nbsp; This theoretical will allow us to study the
 dynamical possibilities of such a system in parameter regimes that 
would not be possible on the macro-scale, thereby aiding us in asking 
questions about what happens at quantum-scales.&nbsp; Further, in 
collaboration with <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="https://faculty.washington.edu/kutz/">Nathan Kutz</a> and the <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="http://dynamicsai.org/">AI Institute in Dynamic Systems</a>, with equipment which <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="https://www.eigensteve.com/">Steve Brunton</a>
 graciously allowed us to use, my students and I are conducting 
experiments on walking droplets to produce quantum-like behavior. We 
then use data-driven techniques such as statistical and machine learning
 to track the droplets and model the data in the form of differential 
equations.<br>

<h4>Logical circuits:</h4>

</p>


<p><img src="IansExp.jpg" alt="RSFF experiment" width="366" align="left" hspace="10" height="197">Logical
 circuits are an integral part of modern life that are traditionally 
designed with minimal uncertainty.&nbsp; While this is straightforward 
to achieve with electronic logic, other logic families such as fluidic, 
chemical, and biological circuits naturally exhibit uncertainties due to
 the slower timescales of Boolean operations.&nbsp; In addition, chaotic
 logical circuits have the potential to be employed in random number 
generation, encryption, and fault tolerance.&nbsp; However, in order to 
exploit the properties of various nonlinear circuits they need to be 
studied further.&nbsp; Since experiments with large systems become 
difficult, tractable mathematical models that are amenable to analysis 
via dynamical systems theory are of particular value.<br>
</p>


<p>We developed a modeling framework for the chaotic Set/Reset flip-flop
 circuit and two types of chaotic NOR gates.&nbsp; Through this 
framework we derive discrete dynamical models for Set/Reset - type 
circuits with any number of NOR gates.&nbsp; Since the models are 
recurrence relations, the computational expense is quite low.&nbsp; 
Further, we conducted experiments to test these models, which shows both
 qualitatively and quantitatively close behavior between the theory and 
experiments.<br>

<h4>Theoretical developments in Dynamical Systems:</h4>
<h4>Sigma map bifurcations:</h4>

<p>Upon discovering a new global bifurcation in discrete dynamical 
models of walking droplets, we developed a generic dynamical system in 
order to generalize the theory of such bifurcations.&nbsp; From a 
graphical point of view, the invariant circle from an initial 
Neimark--Sacker bifurcation "blinks" on and off.&nbsp; This is due to 
the transition from tangential to transverse intersections of the 
unstable and stable manifolds of the saddle fixed point.<br>

<h4>Generalized Attracting Horseshoe:</h4>
<p>We had previously shown that attracting horseshoes may be generalized to be contained within a quadrilateral trapping <img src="file:///Users/rahman/website/TrappingRegion.jpg" alt="Trapping region" width="209" align="right" height="132">region.&nbsp; Through the NJIT Provost high school internship and the 
Provost Phase 1 undergraduate research grant, I mentored Karthik murthy 
(Bridgewater - Raritan High School) and Parth Sojitra (NJIT-ECE) in finding numerical evidence of 
generalized attracting horseshoes (GAH) in Poincare maps of the Rossler 
attractor.&nbsp; I developed the algorithms to go from a first return 
map to a Poincare map and finally to find the quadrilateral trapping 
region for the supposed GAH.&nbsp; I then guided our students in writing
 the MATLAB codes to carry out the algorithms.&nbsp; While finding the 
trapping region numerically is not a proof, it does give us confidence 
that there exists a GAH in the Poincare map of the Rossler attractor.<br>

<h4>Chaotic scattering:</h4>



          
<p>Chaotic scattering has been studied from the early 70s and
            80s in solitary wave collisions from the Phi-Four equation (called Kink-Antikink
            collisions).&nbsp; These were mainly numerical studies that
            gave insight into the phenomena.&nbsp; In more recent years reduction
            techniques have been used to approximate the Phi-Four PDE
            with a system of ODEs and also as an iterated map.&nbsp; We have gone further and developed a mechanical analog (a
            ball rolling on a special surface) of chaotic scattering in
            Kink-Antikink collisions.&nbsp; This was done in order to
            conduct experiments.&nbsp; In addition to experiments we
            have analyzed the system thoroughly, including the
            dissipation that comes from friction.&nbsp; The experimental setup is
            shown bellow.<br>

<h4>Alternate proof of Peixoto's theorem in 1-D:</h4>



          
<p>Peixoto's theorem is one of the most important theorems in
            Dynamical Systems.&nbsp; It was proved by Dr. Mauricio Matos
            Peixoto in 1962.&nbsp; This proof is extremely involved -
            far too involved for most undergraduate students to
            follow.&nbsp; We develop an alternate - pedagogical proof of
            the simpler 1-D case, with the goal of allowing senior
            undergraduate students to follow and understand the proof
            and consequently some of the ideas involved in the much
            bigger proof of the 2-D case.

<h4>Particle Accelerator Physics:</h4>



          
<p> We numerically simulated the beam dynamics of the Energy
            Recovery Linear Particle Accelerator (ERL) design for
            Argonne National Lab's (ANL) Advanced Photon Source
            (APS).&nbsp; The code BI, created by Ivan Bazarov, is
            benchmarked against our own code for simpler
            Accelerators.&nbsp; Then the full ERL was simulated and the
            results were analyzed.&nbsp; We concluded that the ERL, 
would be stable, and therefore a reasonable design for the 
specifications.</p>
